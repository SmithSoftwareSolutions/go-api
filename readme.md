# GoAPI - Work in Progress

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a scalable and robust backend service boilerplate in go while transitioning from a dynamically typed mindset to a more go idomatic mindset.

## Current State
A large portion of the resource service abstraction has been built and is functional. I originally used reflect heavily as a way to make progress quickly and get used to working in go. However, my current goal is to start migrating alot of the abstraction in the service layer to use code generation instead, while still retaining the reflect based utility functions for quick prototyping.

# Next Steps & Improvements
- Code generation tooling
- Controllers
- Tests
- Containerization
